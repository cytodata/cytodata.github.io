The Allen Institute for Cell Science is a division of the Allen Institute, whose mission is to create dynamic and multi-scale visual models of cell organization, dynamics and activities that capture experimental observation, theory and prediction to understand and predict cellular behavior in its normal, regenerative, and pathological contexts.
This year’s theme is “Data analysis and deep learning strategies for image-based profiling in cell biology.</description></item><item><title>CytoData 2021 - by bit.bio</title><link>http://cytodata.org/symposia/2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cytodata.org/symposia/2021/</guid><description>CytoData Symposium 2021 will be hosted virtually by bit.bio from October 13-15, 2021.

Running over 3 days and 3 nights, we’ll begin with a day of talks, networking, and discussion before getting down to the hacking itself. For the Hackathon we’ll prepare a previously unseen imaging dataset. Working in groups, your task will be to develop novel software and analysis techniques to extract information from the dataset.</description></item><item><title>CytoData 2016 Hackaton - by Carpenter Lab</title><link>http://cytodata.org/symposia/2016/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cytodata.org/symposia/2016/</guid><description>Researchers mining image data are gaining momentum: papers are shifting from proof-of-principle to biological discovery. But we are not yet much of a true community, beyond reading each others’ papers and a few pairwise interactions at conferences. We would like to change this by bringing everyone together in the same room! Collectively, we have tremendous knowledge and insights into this challenging field.
