      <description>Loan Vulliard is currently AIH Postdoctoral Fellow at the DKFZ in Heidelberg, Germany. He works together with Felix Hartmann and Julio Saez-Rodriguez to reveal the quantitative principles underlying molecular biology and to better understand human health and diseases. For this, he uses data analysis methods and collaborate with experimentalists and experts in the fields of immunology and cell biology. In particular, he is developing machine learning approaches to identify and contextualize spatial patterns in multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) data.</description>

      <description>Following the success of last years Cytomining Hackathon, where data scientists from 20 of the worlds top high-content screening laboratories came together to set a path for the field, the hackathon is back. Running over 3 days and 3 nights, we’ll begin with a day of talks, networking, and discussion before getting down to the hacking itself. For the Hackathon we’ll prepare a previously unseen imaging dataset. Working in groups, your task will be to develop novel software and analysis techniques to extract information from the dataset.</description>

      <description>Researchers mining image data are gaining momentum: papers are shifting from proof-of-principle to biological discovery. But we are not yet much of a true community, beyond reading each others’ papers and a few pairwise interactions at conferences. We would like to change this by bringing everyone together in the same room! Collectively, we have tremendous knowledge and insights into this challenging field.
