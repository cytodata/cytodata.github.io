He works together with Felix Hartmann and Julio Saez-Rodriguez to reveal the quantitative principles underlying molecular biology and to better understand human health and diseases. For this, he uses data analysis methods and collaborate with experimentalists and experts in the fields of immunology and cell biology. In particular, he is developing machine learning approaches to identify and contextualize spatial patterns in multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) data.</description></item></channel></rss>
