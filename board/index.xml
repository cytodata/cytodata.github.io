He works together with Felix Hartmann and Julio Saez-Rodriguez to reveal the quantitative principles underlying molecular biology and to better understand human health and diseases. For this, he uses data analysis methods and collaborate with experimentalists and experts in the fields of immunology and cell biology. In particular, he is developing machine learning approaches to identify and contextualize spatial patterns in multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) data.</description></item><item><title>Alexandr Kalinin</title><link>http://cytodata.org/board/alexkalinin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cytodata.org/board/alexkalinin/</guid><description>Alex Kalinin is a Postdoctoral Associate in Machine learning for Computational Biology at the Imaging Plaform of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where he works with Shantanu Singh and Anne Carpenter. He is interested in developing and applying machine learning methods for studying cellular organization and improving disease diagnosis and treatment.

My research group focuses on developing and applying machine learning methods for image-based profiling of microscopy imaging data. We study deep learning methods to extract complex information from fluorescence microscopy images of human cell and tissue samples that are employed for instance in cancer precision medicine applications. I was the CytoData society president 2020-2021.
Responsibilities Organize the CytoData2023 event and keep documentation of CytoData events.</description></item><item><title>Paula A.
